# Sequence-Bond-Distance-Calculation
A very specific python script to calculate bond distances from any number of crystal structure refinements. This code is intended to be used for time-resolved XRD powder diffraction and Rietveld refinements.

Intended for use with the CSV data output from GSAS-II.  

I'm working to make this code a bit more general, so that a user can select the data file, and then select which atoms they want bond distances for.  Currently, this is all hard-wired in the code.
